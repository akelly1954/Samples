# QtSample

This whole project is devoted to integrating Qt5 into this Cmake and Eclipse build environment.

The programs compiled are taken from the Qt tutorials and examples just to keep things simple for now.

The install and rebuild portions of the first project (text_finder) are not working 100% yet. This will be
enhanced in the near future.
