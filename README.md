# Samples

# Welcome.  Please Note:

This is work in progress -- I'm uploading my sources to the repository while ensuring that the code is tested, building properly (at least on my system), and working. So for a period of time I've got restrictions on interactions with the repositories that allow one to clone and/or download the code (to which you are welcome as per the LICENSE) but am not yet welcoming collaborators. Right now I only have some basic libraries that are still skeletal in nature, and there are more objects coming.  As soon as I introduce code that does something more useful, I'll remove the restrictions.  In the meantime, if there's something critically important you need to communicate, please email me at **andrew@akelly.com**.

Thank you.

**SEE ALSO:** The README.md file in the **source** folder (./source/README.md).

## A collection of C++ objects (libraries), and some executable programs that utilize those objects.

The sources are organized in a source tree which is built using cmake (minimum version 3.10). There are (will be) additional README files in the subdirectories going into more detail of how to use the build environment.  

New work is checked into the **dev** branch. The **main** branch is stable. 

See the **source/README.md** file for detail about the file/directory structure, build tools, and how to build the sources. 

This is an "out of source" build environment. Mostly.  Check the **./.gitignore** file to see what's ignored. The **build** directory can always be removed without affecting any source files.  

Even though the IDE and build environment are set here as the defaults (eclipse, gnu toolchain), the Eclipse IDE is not required. 

### Current deficiencies:

Currently the Windows' WIN32 configuration has not been built and tested yet. 
This may be added in the future.

**NEXT**: Read the **source/README.md** information for more info.
